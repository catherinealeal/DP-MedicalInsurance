# Predicting Medical Costs with Linear Regression

## Background + Goal

Medical insurance companies provide coverage to customers based on their predicted yearly medical costs. For example, people under the age of 30 typically have lower insurance costs than people over the age of 60 because they seek less medical care throughout the year. Insurance companies can evaluate an individual's annual insurance premium based on many factors like age, sex, and smoking habits. 

The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that predicts an individualâ€™s yearly medical costs based on their background information. A successful model should explain at least 70% of the variability in annual expenses. Such a model could be used by ACME Inc. to estimate monthly premium charges for new customers.
